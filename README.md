# Alpha-Toe-Zero

**Alpha-Toe-Zero** is a clean, educational implementation of DeepMind's [AlphaZero](https://deepmind.google/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/) algorithm. It masters **Tic-Tac-Toe (2D)** and **4x4x4 3D Tic-Tac-Toe** entirely through self-play reinforcement learning, starting with zero human knowledge.

This project includes a high-performance training pipeline, a CLI for interacting with models, and a modern web-based interactive explainer.

## 🌟 Key Features

  * **Dual Game Support:** Full implementations for both 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe and complex 4x4x4 Qubic.
  * **AlphaZero Core:** Combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with ResNet-based deep neural networks.
  * **Self-Play Training:** Generates its own training data using MCTS to improve iteratively.
  * **Advanced Techniques:**
      * **Data Augmentation:** Exploits 8 dihedral symmetries (2D) and cube symmetries (3D) to multiply training efficiency.
      * **Dirichlet Noise:** Adds exploration noise to the root node to prevent local optima.
      * **Temperature Annealing:** Dynamic control of exploration vs. exploitation during game generation.
  * **Parallel Processing:** Uses multiprocessing to speed up self-play game generation.
  * **Interactive Web App:** A React/Vite web application to visualize the agent and play against it in 3D.

## Installation

Requires **Python 3.11+**.

### 1\. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nottherealsanta/alpha-toe-zero.git
cd alpha-toe-zero
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

You can use standard `pip` or `uv` for faster dependency management.

```bash
# Using pip
pip install -e .

# Using uv (Recommended)
uv sync
```

-----

## Usage

The project is divided into 2D (Tic-Tac-Toe) and 3D (Qubic) modules.

### Training a Model

The training pipeline runs self-play games, trains the neural net, and evaluates progress.

```bash
# Train 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe agent
cd 2d
python main.py

# Train 4x4x4 Qubic agent
cd 3d
python qubic.py
```

### Play Against the AI (CLI)

Once you have a trained model (check the `models/` directory), you can challenge it.

```bash
cd 2d
# Replace with your specific checkpoint path
python play.py --model-path ../models/alphazero_iter_40.pth
```

### Run the Web Interface

The `teach/` directory contains a full web application for playing the 3D game and visualizing the network.

```bash
cd teach
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Run a Tournament

Compare different iterations of your model to measure improvement using Elo ratings.

```bash
cd 2d
python tournament.py \
    --models ../models/alphazero_iter_0.pth ../models/alphazero_iter_40.pth \
    --games-per-pair 20 \
    --mcts-simulations 200
```

## System Architecture

The system follows the standard AlphaZero loop, iterating between generating data via self-play and improving the neural network.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Self-Play Phase"
        A[MCTS Search] -->|Generates| B[Game History]
        B -->|Augmentation| C[Training Buffer]
    end
    
    subgraph "Training Phase"
        C -->|Sample Batch| D[Neural Network]
        D -->|Update Weights| D
        D -->|New Checkpoint| A
    end
```

### Neural Network (ResNet)

  * **Input:** The board state encoded into binary planes (Current Player, Opponent).
  * **Backbone:** 4 Residual Blocks with Batch Normalization.
  * **Heads:**
      * **Value Head:** Predicts game outcome `[-1, 1]`.
      * **Policy Head:** Predicts probability distribution over all valid moves.
